# odin-recipes
First Odin project - Recipes
With this project I'll create a basic HTML page. It'll include basic tags like html, head, title, body, a href, img src, p, br, em, strong, lists etc.
This project will strengthen my HTML skills and basic git commands for maintaining my repo.
Wish me luck!
